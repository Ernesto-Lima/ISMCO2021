## How can (experimental) data go on tumor growth models?

Our goal in this tutorial is to show an introduction about modeling in the context of cancer, addressing discrete, continuous, and hybrid models. Examples and interpretation of different types of functions are addressed for the description of tumor growth, mortality, and therapies, among other biological phenomena. We also aim to introduce the attendees to the Python programming language, methods of solving ordinary differential equation models, and model calibration via Bayesian methods. The attendees will have hands-on experience on ordinary differential equation solvers and model calibration.

### Intended Audience
Any person interested in the development and calibration of tumor models, or people already familiar with tumor models that are interested in learning how to calibrate these models.

### Background assumed
No pre-requisites are required to follow this tutorial. We will give an introduction to Python such as everyone can follow the exercises.

### Objectives
• Provide an overview on the development of tumor growth models.

• Provide an introduction to Python and how to solve ordinary differential equations.

• Provide hands-on training on how to calibrate tumor growth models.

### Duration
Full-day course.

### Activities
• Development of tumor growth models (theory): an introduction to discrete, continuous, and hybrid models. Our goal is to familiarize the participants with the biological motivation for using different models of tumor growth.

• Introduction to Python + Development of tumor growth models (hands-on): show basic concepts of Python (variables, read/write files, loops, …) and how to solve ordinary differential equation models and visualize the results.

• Calibration of tumor growth models (theory and hands-on): an introduction to concepts related to Bayesian calibration. We will present a brief introduction to model calibration and the Bayesian theory. In the hands-on part, the attendees will generate in silico data using the model implemented in (2) and calibrate the model parameters using the emcee Python library.
